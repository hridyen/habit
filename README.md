Description:

Habit is a productivity and habit-tracking application designed to help users build and maintain healthy habits. With Habit, users can set goals, track their progress, and stay motivated through reminders and analytics. The app tracks daily habits, allowing users to add, delete, and rename their habits by swiping left on the main screen. Data is stored using Hive local storage. When a habit is checked, it is displayed in a heat map, with more frequent checks resulting in a darker color, allowing users to see their progress monthly.
